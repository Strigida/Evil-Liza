    		<p> Liz Altmiller, unbeknownst to most, began her career as a Supreme Being with the power to save the earth from certain destruction. However, before Liz could reach in and save the earth from doom, another flame-haired character named “LeeLoo” stepped in and took care of the situation. Liz was good natured about the stolen job opportunity, though, and LeeLoo and Liz sat around and traded stories for a while until LeeLoo mentioned something about having to go fight a zombie situation at a little obscure business called “The Umbrella Corporation”. 
    		</p>
            <p>Liz, looking for another adventure, took to space. There, aboard the Starship Enterprise, she met a chef, Evie Wells, that boasted of winning Master Chef for a total of nine consecutive seasons. Even though Evie came across as exceedingly vain, Liz could see that Evie was in fact, actually quite kind hearted, and the two became fast friends. Liz, a natural a natural at cooking, herself, joined Evie’s side in the kitchen of the Enterprise, and the two of them worked together to thwart several universal calamities through the means of their cooking skills (calamities and the means of solving them I will not go into describing here, as that is for another story). When one such cookery daring-do took a bit of a wrong turn and caused an even bigger universal calamity (also for another story), the two of them jumped ship to land aboard the Tardis.
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor immediately took to them, and the three of them became fast friends. But the Doctor didn’t let them stay long aboard the Tardis, as he claimed that the world would miss out on something monumental if the two of them did not return to earth once more. The Doctor understood their combined powers to be of a great value that would someday save the earth, but he would leave it up to them to discover just what that combined power was. Stranded on earth by the Doctor, the two of them didn’t lose hope, but began to create music together, as both of them had always held a deep and passionate obsession for music. 
Evie and Liz realized that this was the combined power that would save the earth one day: their music. And so, the band “Evil-Liza” was formed.
